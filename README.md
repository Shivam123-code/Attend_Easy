# attend_easy

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


1. What the project does:
The AttendEasy App is a digital attendance management system designed to replace traditional pen-and-paper attendance systems. The app allows lecturers to generate a unique, time-sensitive code with a specified radius, which students can use to check in for attendance. By leveraging geolocation technology, the app ensures that students are physically present within the designated area to be marked as "present." This eliminates proxy attendance and streamlines the entire attendance-taking process.


2. Why the project is useful:
The AttendEasy App is useful because it automates the attendance process, saving time and reducing the chances of human error or fraud (such as proxy attendance). By integrating location-based services using the Geolocator package in Flutter, the app ensures that only students within the specified range and timeframe can mark their attendance. This makes the system more accurate, efficient, and secure compared to traditional methods. The app is especially beneficial for educational institutions and workplaces that require accurate tracking of attendance.




3. How users can get started with the project:
Users can get started with the AttendEasy App by following these steps:

Create an Account (if required): Users (both lecturers and students) may need to sign up with their credentials or log in using their existing credentials.
For Lecturers: Once logged in, lecturers can generate a unique six-digit code for attendance. They can also set the expiry time and the radius within which the code is valid.
For Students: Students can log in, input the generated code, and check in within the valid time and location range.



5. Who maintains and contributes to the project:
The AttendEasy App is maintained and developed by Shivam Kumar (or the appropriate project maintainer), a student focused on creating innovative solutions in the field of software development. Contributions are welcome from developers who are interested in improving the app by submitting pull requests on the GitHub repository. The project is open-source, and anyone with experience in Flutter, Python, or mobile app development can contribute. To contribute, developers can fork the repository, make changes, and create a pull request for review.
